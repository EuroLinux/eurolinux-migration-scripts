# description: Run migration-related tests provided as parameters.
# This script shall be ran **inside** a box with the necessary files rsynced
# (the whole project's directory by default). With automated tests you'll most
# likely want to `vagrant up box`, ensuring that this script landed in a box,
# first and run this script with a wrapper executed on a **Vagrant host** like:
# `vagrant ssh box -c "cd /vagrant/tests && \
#   ./run_migration_test.sh test1 test2 test3" | tee -a my_tests_logs.log`
